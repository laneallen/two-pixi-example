# Two.js to Pixi.js Example

This is just my testing of utilizing Two.js to pull in svg content, render it in a hidden canvas, then pulling that data into Pixi.js. Credits to [UIHacker](http://uihacker.blogspot.com/2014/10/javascript-use-twojs-to-prepare-svg.html) for the initial concept so I could put it all together.

### Reasoning for this:
By utilizing svg, you can provide "optimized" assets that are quicker to download, which is especially critical for mobile distribution. This is true for download sizes of assets, in addition to, scaling one source of assets depending on screen resolution of the user (i.e. retina, etc.).
